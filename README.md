#question-and-answer

This is my attempt to create a clone of stackoverflow in a working sense hosted on github pages.

When complete, the application should have all the same functionality that stackoverflow.com has, with the exception of styling.

####Non authenticated users should be able to

*Search for questions
*Results should be sortable
*View question answers
*View the tag cloud
*Authenticate

####Authenticated users should be able to

*View own profile
*View own Badges
*View own favorites
*View own answers
*Upvote, downvote and favorite answers and questions
*Log out
