cloned-stack
============

This is my attempt to create a clone of stackoverflow in a working sense hosted on github pages.

When complete, the application should have all the same functionality that stackoverflow.com has, with the exception of styling.

#### Non authenticated users should be able to
* Search for questions
* Results should be sortable
* View question answers
* View the tag cloud
* Authenticate

#### Authenticated users should be able to
* View own profile
* View own Badges
* View own favorites
* View own answers
* Upvote, downvote and favorite answers and questions
* Log out

<!-- Technical Requirements
* Application must be hosted on github pages (https://pages.github.com) with access to source code
* You may use any web front-end technology
* You may use any architecture and design patterns
* The user interface must have the look and feel of a Blizzard web site
* Provide justification for your choices with your submission -->
